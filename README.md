# AI empowers your mind to reach anywhere

## What is this?

This is a framework to support 14-15 year old students learning foreign languages (equivalent to 9th graders in Japan), along with their parents and teachers.

Students can receive free AI-powered explanations covering pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar (structural analysis + practical explanations), and translation (literal + natural expressions).

Due to the nature of large language models, AI probabilistically produces hallucinations. **So instead of supervising whether AI might be wrong, students can reduce busywork and spend more time memorizing and using language.** Students probably have friends who speak different languages on platforms like Discord.

Some families may face economic constraints that prevent them from affording educational expenses. Learning alongside AI makes this possible.

And teachers can observe whether students are using language and AI appropriately.

Have fun!

## Quick Start

1. Please understand the MIT License
2. Read "A Message from the Heart"
3. You can view Japanese and English demos on YouTube (URLs are provided below)
4. [Japanese](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/AI-empowers-your-mind-to-reach-anywhere/blob/main/Study-Japanese-Prompt-Examp.md) and [English](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara/AI-empowers-your-mind-to-reach-anywhere/blob/main/Study-English-Prompt-Example.md) prompt samples are available—please try them in your environment

## FAQ

### 1. Who owns the copyright to the sample texts in this framework?

The English text is from [my own research paper](https://www.academia.edu/130269659/future_AI_x_dignity_Two_Year_Zero_Incident_Report_and_Primary_Sources) abstract, and I hold the copyright.

The Japanese sample for learning English comes from Torahiko Terada's work, [available here](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000042/files/2359_13797.html).

[Aozora Bunko](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/) is a digital library of public domain Japanese content. I believe you'll find authors that resonate with your sensibilities there.

Torahiko Terada was this person: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torahiko_Terada

I chose his work because it's not overly archaic as Japanese goes, and it's excellent from an educational perspective.

### 2. Can this framework be misused for translation purposes?

**No**. This can be done with simple prompts. As of July 9, 2025, it works with DeepSeek R1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro—technologies that are freely available.

By leveling the playing field with equal opportunities, young people can dream of making a difference in humanitarian aid and education. I want to support those suffering from despair through technology. When people don't have to despair, they're more likely to contribute to society.

### 3. Are you trying to replace language teachers with AI?

**Absolutely not**. AI currently makes mistakes due to hallucinations, bias, and algorithmic issues.

Therefore, teachers have an even more sophisticated role that only humans can fulfill—ensuring students don't learn incorrectly.

Simply put, this framework aims to free teachers from busywork.

### 4. Is it only for Japanese and English?

The UN's official languages are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

Japanese, Korean, and any other language should be applicable within the scope of what AI has learned.

### 5. What about extensibility?

For example, you could create SQL that records "words you got wrong" in a program.
By having AI analyze either the SQL itself or exported data to find patterns in vocabulary and grammar you struggle with, your learning could accelerate. If you can build smartphone apps, you might gather users for free and compete with language learning apps by offering advanced analysis through monthly subscriptions.

Alternatively, by selecting a usable Gemma 3 model and running it completely locally, you could protect your privacy and solve data sovereignty issues.

### 6. What's the point of learning languages anyway?

You'll make friends from different language communities.

You can become a developer on GitHub.

So, AI empowers your mind to reach anywhere.


## A Message from the Heart
Thank you for finding your way to this framework.
This project is MIT licensed—please use it freely, commercially or otherwise.
If you're thinking about building something with this, consider making it educational. There's something beautiful about helping others learn, and it tends to build the kind of trust and reputation that becomes invaluable over time.
My hope is simple: that this little tool helps someone discover something new, and that somehow, that contributes to your own journey toward happiness.

So, AI empowers your mind to reach anywhere.
